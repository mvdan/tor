 * \file consdiff.c
 * \brief Consensus diff implementation, including both the generation and the
 * application of diffs in a minimal ed format.
 *
 * The consensus diff application is done in consdiff_apply_diff, which relies
 * on apply_ed_diff for the main ed diff part and on some digest helper
 * functions to check the digest hashes found in the consensus diff header.
 *
 * The consensus diff generation is more complex. consdiff_gen_diff generates
 * it, relying on gen_ed_diff to generate the ed diff and some digest helper
 * functions to generate the digest hashes.
 *
 * gen_ed_diff is the tricky bit. In it simplest form, it will take quadratic
 * time and linear space to generate an ed diff given two smartlists. As shown
 * in its comment section, calling calc_changes on the entire two consensuses
 * will calculate what is to be added and what is to be deleted in the diff.
 * Its comment section briefly explains how it works.
 *
 * In our case specific to consensuses, we take advantage of the fact that
 * consensuses list routers sorted by their identities. We use that
 * information to avoid running calc_changes on the whole smartlists.
 * gen_ed_diff will navigate through the two consensuses identity by identity
 * and will send small couples of slices to calc_changes, keeping the running
 * time near-linear. This is explained in more detail in the gen_ed_diff
 * comments.
