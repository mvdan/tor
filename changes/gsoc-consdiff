o New features (consensus diffs):
  - Add support for consensus diffs throughout the network. Directory
	authorities and relays will keep a number of old consensuses and generate
	ed diffs to be served to other nodes. Thus most consensus downloads should
	be incremental and much smaller than before. Implements proposal 140.

  - Add two consensus parameters to configure the number of old consensuses
	that directory authorities and relays should keep. Note that entire
	consensuses will be compressed and stored on disk, so your Tor folder may
	get bigger than before in the order of a couple to a few dozen megabytes.
